This submission has the solely purpose of defining the problem or task that will be solved by means of Machine Learning Algorithms using Foursquare location data. All the required tasks to accomplish the project goals will be part of the final report. \n\n>Since the goal of the project is segmenting places in the city of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, let's begin by exploring some interesting facts about the beautiful city of Z\u00fcrich:\n\n> Z\u00fcrich or Zurich (/\u02c8zj\u028a\u0259r\u026ak/ ZEWR-ik) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The municipality has approximately 409,000 inhabitants. Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\n\n>Z\u00fcrich is a leading global city and among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to a large number of financial institutions and banking companies. Most of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in Z\u00fcrich and the low tax rates attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters there. Info taken from: [Z\u00fcrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich)\n\n**Problem or idea Definition**\n\n> The main goal of this project is to provide business intelligence for an international company that is willing to open a new restaurant supply shop in Z\u00fcrich. The target market for this kind of business is limited to those within the culinary community. This includes: restaurants, culinary schools, cafeterias(including medical and schools), bars, caterers, bakeries and coffee shops. Therefore, it is of major importance clustering places around the city and find out which ones of those concentrate venues which belong to the target market. This information will help decision makers choosing the right place for opening shops, planning logistics, calculating costs and designing better marketing campaigns.     \n\n<a id='projectdetails'></a>\n## Project Details\n>Main tasks in this project are as follows:\n>1. Gathering data\n>2. Assessing and cleaning data\n>3. Creating Visualizations\n>4. Using the Foursquare API to gather venues information.\n>5. Clustering.\n>6. Results analysis and giving recommedations.\n\n### Data Source\n>1. **Zurich - postal codes**\n\n>All the information regarding postal codes for the different neighborhoods in the city of Z\u00fcrich will be gathered from the website [geonames_postalcodes_CH](https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/CH/ZH/zurich.html) performing web scraping with the help of BeatifulSoup and then converting the data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.\n\n>2. **Additional Data via the Foursquare API**\n\n> All the data related to venues will be gathered from Foursquare location data using their API.
